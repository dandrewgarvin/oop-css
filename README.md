# OOP-CSS

*Cascading Style Sheets.* The bane of many web-developers' existence.

Mugs, T-shirts, Stickers, and Gifs have all been made to show the high level of loathing these developers have toward this piece of technology. My personal favorite is this gif of Peter Griffin:

But never fear, front-end developers. Your problems are soon to increase exponentially. Let me introduce you to `OOP-CSS` (AKA `OOPS`).

## What is `OOP-CSS` (`OOPS`)?

OOPS is a poor, humorous attempt at taking the well-disliked syntax of CSS, and turning it into Object-Oriented Programming language. It is by no means intended to become a feature-filled language (if it was, I'd have written a real Lexer, Parser, and Evaluator), but instead is a spoof-of-concept idea that I thought would be fun to make.

## Notes

This project was built in a very short period of time, and I, the author, would like to take full credit for the idea/project, but request that anyone looking at this code does not judge me for the way it was written. Since this project was just for fun, I wasn't worried about optimizing the code, but instead wrote it only in a way that worked.
