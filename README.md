# OOP-CSS

*Cascading Style Sheets.* The bane of many web-developers' existence.

Mugs, T-shirts, Stickers, and Gifs have all been made to show the high level of loathing these developers have toward this piece of technology. My personal favorite is this gif of Peter Griffin:

But never fear, front-end developers. Your problems are soon to increase exponentially. Let me introduce you to `OOP-CSS` (AKA `OOPS`).

## What is `OOP-CSS` (`OOPS`)?

OOPS is a poor, humorous attempt at taking the well-disliked syntax of CSS, and turning it into Object-Oriented Programming language. It is by no means intended to become a feature-filled language (if it was, I'd have written a real Lexer, Parser, and Evaluator), but instead is a spoof-of-concept idea that I thought would be fun to make.

## Notes

This project was built in a very short period of time, and I, the author, would like to take full credit for the idea/project, but request that anyone looking at this code does not judge me for the way it was written. Since this project was just for fun, I wasn't worried about optimizing the code, but instead wrote it only in a way that worked.

## TODO

- [x] Remove comments from code
- [x] Break code into json blocks
- [x] Save ast-temp.json file for documentation
- [ ] File should not be hard-coded in, but be received from stdin
- [ ] :root variables in JSON file should be saved as JS variables
- [ ] .function blocks should be turned into JS function blocks
- [ ] .function::before block should declare parameters (if not exists, no parameters)
- [ ] .function::after (if exists) should invoke function block
